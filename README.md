Have you ever wondered why Jupyter uses raster (and not SVG) as the inline graphics format by default?\
Or why it does not offer a "Save as PDF/SVG" button below each plot (best if also compatible with Colab)?\
Or why it does not support animated plots that render on GitHub? \
Our feelings exactly!

Here is a solution for Python notebooks using matplotlib: `import open_atmos_jupyter_utils as oaju`, replace `pyplot.show()` with `oaju.show_plot()`, and use `oaju.show_anim()` for animations.
Finally, does integration of research notebooks with automated software testing workflows sound useful? Check out the `oaju.notebook_vars()` function that can be used with pytest fixtures to streamline execution of Jupyter notebook code once per test session. This allows asserting on the final notebook state from multiple fast-executing tests (without modifications to the notebooks themselves, and with plot handling compatible with `show_plot` and `show_anim`).

The maintenance of research-result reproducibility can support rather than be a challenge of ongoing project development.
The integration of research notebooks with automated software testing workflows is an essential prerequisite for this. 
We present reusable tools and solutions engineered in the development and maintenance of the [PySDM](https://open-atmos.github.io/PySDM) and [PyMPDATA](https://open-atmos.github.io/PyMPDATA) atmospheric modeling projects.
Both packages are developed entirely in Python, using just-in-time compilation tools (Numba \& NVRTC) to enable a single-language HPC tech stack that covers simulation, analysis, and visualization codes.
We will discuss the perspectives of both user and developer on reproducibility.

### **[CoPartCoFlow summer school](https://sites.google.com/view/copartcoflow/copartcoflow) Complex particle transport in complex flows with environmental applications:** _On the timescale of water isotopic equilibration in a raindrop/ambient-air system_
[![link to poster](https://img.shields.io/badge/-poster-lightblue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/AgnieszkaZaba/talks/blob/main/2025_CoPartCoFlow_poster.pdf)

Stable water isotopes such as deuterium, oxygen-18 and oxygen-17 are used as tracers in atmospheric water-cycle analyses. Here, we focus on liquid-water clouds and precipitation. Considering a raindrop/ambient-air vapour diffusion process, the isotopic composition dynamics are driven by the differences in water diffusional coefficients and equilibrium vapour pressures for semi-light ($HDO$), light ($H_2O$) and heavy-oxygen ($H_2^{18}O$, $H_2 ^{17}O$) water. These dynamics lead to isotopic fractionation effects. In the poster, we will discuss approaches to quantify the fractionation effects by analysing the e-folding time scales of mass diffusion. This work is a part of a project aimed at development of particle-based cloud microphysics model capturing the links between the thermodynamic conditions within a cloud and the isotopic composition of surface precipitation.
